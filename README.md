# Housing-Prices-Prediction-using-various-Linear-Models

##Problem Description:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

The notebook tests 3 different models and evaluates the best possible model for the job.

##Models Tested
* CART Model
* Random Forest
* Linear Regression using Ridge Regression
